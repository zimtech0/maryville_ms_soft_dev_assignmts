Why utilize maps and graphs as structures instead of trees?  

What are the advantages and disadvantages?

Trees can be viewed as special types of graphs. Rooted trees can be viewed as directed graphs with the lack of direct cycles.

Additionally, when we attempt to model certain processes or systems, trees are not sufficient since there is a need to represent things like cycles, undirected connections, and other properties.

Using a road map as an example,w e cannot represent a road map with trees since a map consists of cycles and connected components which could never be represented using a tree.

The advantage of using a graph  to represent a roadmap is that it is highly relatable to real world modelling, making it easier for everyone to understand.

However some real world problems cause the graph model to become very complex in represenation.
